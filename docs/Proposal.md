**Student Name**: Peter jackson Link, III  
**Degree and Major**: B.S. in Computer Science & B.A. in Biblical Languages  
**Project Advisor Name**: Dr. Sean Hayes   
**Expected Graduation Date**: May 2026


Problem Statement
-----------------

In Biblical Studies, there are many helpful scholarly resources that can be more easily used with the aid of computer interfaces. Ideally, it would be possible to integrate the ~2,000 years of historical biblical commentary and original language manuscripts in a way that is accessible and free for the layperson. This would help in people’s personal studies, since they could see more clearly the original meaning and semantics of words in the text and see how the Church has wrestled with certain passages for almost two millenia.

Sadly, the very best tools for biblical studies are currently quite expensive. They are only feasible for people who make biblical study their vocation, such as pastors and scholars. I propose to build a free platform that allows a layperson to easily study the scriptures with the help of original language studies and historical commentaries.


Project Description
-------------------

A web application that allows users to read the Bible while allowing easy utilization of public-domain resources and commentaries.


Proposed Implementation Language(s) 
-----------------------------------

 - Common Lisp
 - HTML indirectly
 - CSS indirectly
 - JavaScript indirectly


Libraries, Packages, Development Kits, etc. to be used in the proposed implementation languages(s)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Ningle
 - Spinneret
 - Parenscript
 - Alexandria
 - Serapeum
 - CSS-lite
 - HTMX
 - Clack/Lack
 - Hunchentoot
 - Woo
 - Fn
 - Transducers
 - Plump
 - Cl-binary-store
 - Modf
 - Str
 - AP5


Additional Software/Equipment Needed
------------------------------------

 - Emacs
 - Vi
 - OpenBSD
 - GNU/Linux
 - Cloudflare
 - Linode

Personal Motivation
-------------------

This will allow me to integrate my studies from my other major with my Computer Science skills. It will also allow me to learn more about building custom web frameworks with Common Lisp.

Outline of Future Research Efforts
----------------------------------

 - Further integrate AP5, Ningle, and Spinneret into an MVC web framework.
 - Work on creating an idiot-proof build system from the framework.
 - Experiment with further abstractions so the framework is more ergonomic.
